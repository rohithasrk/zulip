    * **Change only this message topic**

        This option only changes the topic of the message that you have selected.

        You may want to select this option if you sent the message to the wrong topic.

    * **Change later messages to this topic**

        This option changes the topic of the selected message as well as the topic of any messages under the same topic that were sent after the selected message.

        You may want to select this option if you feel that some messages have gone off-topic.

    * **Change previous and following messages to this topic**

        This option changes the topic of the selected message as well as any messages under the same topic that were sent before and after the selected message.

        You may want to select this option to change the topic for all messages with the same topic.

5. After choosing the option you desire from the dropdown, click the blue **Save** button under the box containing the message's contents.
