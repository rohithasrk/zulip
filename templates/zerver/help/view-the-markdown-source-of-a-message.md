## View the markdown source of a message

If one of your peers sends a message, you can view the markdown of the
message to learn more about formatting tricks or to reuse their markdown
in a reply.

To view the markdown source of an message, simply hover your mouse over
the message and press the down chevron button
(![down chevron](/static/images/help/down_chevron.png)) near the upper right corner.

Next, press on the **View Source** button and you should see this
screen pop up, showing you the original markdown source for the
message.

the message.

    own messages once they are too old to edit.
