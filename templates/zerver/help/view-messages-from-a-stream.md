# View messages from a stream

![home view](/static/images/help/home-view.png)

In the home view, you'll see messages from all streams and topics. However,
you may only want to see messages from a single stream. This is also
called 'narrowing' to a stream.

To view messages from a stream, select the stream from the stream list on
the left.

![narrowed view](/static/images/help/narrowed-view.png)

Only messages from the selected stream will be displayed.

In the stream list, the stream whose messages are currently being viewed
will be highlighted in blue, and the topics in that stream will be
displayed below the stream name.

An alternative way to view messages from only one stream is to type
**stream:** in the search bar at the top, and then enter the name of the
stream whose messages you want to view. Autocomplete options to narrow to a
stream will appear as you type.

You can view messages from a stream that you're not subscribed to through
the search bar, but you'll generally want to subscribe to streams whose
messages you want to view.
