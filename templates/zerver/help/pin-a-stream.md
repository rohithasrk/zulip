# Pinning a stream

Pinning a stream will put that stream at the top of your streams sidebar.
If you are subscribed to a lot of streams,
pinning your favorite streams can be a good way to keep things organized.

## How to pin a stream

There are two easy ways to pin a stream:

### Pinning a stream using the sidebar

The quickest way to pin a stream is by using the
**Pin stream ... to top** feature on the sidebar.

1) On the sidebar, hover over the stream you want to pin and press the
arrow to the right of the stream name.

### Pinning a stream using the stream settings

The other way to pin a stream is by ticking the **Pin stream to top of
left sidebar** box in the stream settings.

1) Open your subscription settings by pressing the gear at the top of
the left sidebar.

## How to unpin a stream

Unpinning a stream works the same way as pinning a stream. You can:
- Press the arrow to the right of the stream you want to unpin and
select **Unpin stream ... from top**, or
- Open your subscription settings, select the stream you want to unpin
and untick the box **Pin stream to top of left sidebar**
