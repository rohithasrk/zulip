# Change Stream Color
Zulip allows you to change stream colors to better customize an environment
that best suits you.

### Using the streams sidebar
The streams sidebar is the fastest approach to changing the color of a stream, to use this:

1. Hover your cursor over the stream you would like to edit, then click the **down chevron**(![Down chevron](/static/images/help/chevron.png)) that will appear to the right of the stream name.
2. From the pop-up menu select your desired stream color from the preset colors or open the color picker by clicking **Choose custom color**.

You can also edit the color of a Stream from the **Subscriptions page**.
