# Unsubscribe from a stream

If you want to stop receiving messages from a particular stream in Zulip, you can choose to unsubscribe from that stream.

There are two major ways to unsubscribe from a stream: unsubscribing from a stream through the stream browser and unsubscribing from a stream through the stream sidebar.

## Unsubscribing from a stream through the stream browser
If you want to unsubscribe from multiple streams at once, you should unsubscribe from streams through the stream browser.

{!subscriptions.md!}

3. Locate the stream that you want to unsubscribe from in the stream browser. You can search for specific streams by entering the name of the stream in the **Filter streams** search box.

5. The green checkmark should now disappear, confirming your unsubscription from the stream.

## Unsubscribing from a stream through the stream sidebar

If you want to quickly unsubscribe from a single stream, you can do so through the stream sidebar.

1. In the left sidebar, locate the **Streams** section. It shows all streams that you are currently subscribed to.
