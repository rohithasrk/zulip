# Mute a topic

If you would like to stop receiving notifications from a certain topic, you can
choose to mute it.

There are two main ways of muting a topic; you can mute a topic through the
stream list or through your view.

## Muting a topic through the stream list

1. Find the stream list located at the left sidebar.

belongs to. Upon clicking on the stream, a dropdown with all the topics in the
stream will appear.

## Muting a topic through your view

1. The default **Home** view displays all messages from unmuted streams and topics
that you've subscribed to. You can choose to search for messages belonging to
the topic that you wish to mute in the **Home** view.

    Alternatively, you can narrow your view to messages sent to the topic that
    you want to mute by entering the search operator `topic:(topic name)` in the
    search bar.

over of the topic's messages to reveal a chevron
(![chevron](/static/images/help/chevron.png)) icon that replaces the timestamp
of the message.
