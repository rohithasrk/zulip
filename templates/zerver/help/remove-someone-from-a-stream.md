# Remove someone from a stream

As an administrator, Zulip allows you to remove users from streams to
help manage your Zulip team. You can do this by accessing the
**Subscriptions** page.

## Finding the subscriptions page

### Remove user
Once on the **subscriptions page**:

1. Select the stream you wish to remove the user from by either
   searching for its name or finding it in the streams list.

2. Under **Stream Settings**, scroll down to the **Stream Membership** section.

3. Finally, find and click the red **Unsubscribe** button next to the user you
want to remove from the stream.
