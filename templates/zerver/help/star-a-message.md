# Starring a message
Starring messages is a good way to keep track of important messages, such as tasks you need to go back to, or documents you reference often.
### Star a message
You can star a message by hovering over any message. The timestamp of the message should be replaced with three context buttons while hovering, one of which is a star. Click on this to star the message.

When a message is starred, a small green star appears next to the timestamp of the message.

### Unstar a message
Click on the green star to unstar a message, returning it to being unfilled.

### View a starred message
You can view all messages you've starred by filtering with the term `is:starred`. This term can be combined with any other filter or search term.

You can also click the "Starred Messages" option on the sidebar to filter to only starred messages.
